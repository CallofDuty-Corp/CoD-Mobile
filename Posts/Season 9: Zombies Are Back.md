### The Return of Zombies!

What’s Halloween without the shambling undead? This season, we’re bringing back Zombies featuring two modes:

Zombies Classic: Brave Shi No Numa aka the Swamp of Death as you and your squad attempt to survive the rounds, facing an onslaught of the undead throughout. Get your Perks and hit up that Mystery Box; you’ll need all the help you can get.

Super Attack of the Undead: Deploy as a full group of survivors until one is randomly chosen at the start of the match to join the undead. In this new iteration of the mode, the match goes on until the last human or zombie is standing. Both the infected and survivors gain new capabilities as the match progresses. Do you have what it takes to make it to the end?

### New Multiplayer Map: Haunted Hacienda

Halloween arrives at the lavish vineyard estate as Hacienda is transformed for the holiday, including a ghostly set of ships anchored just off the lakefront. Take the fight to the mansion — watch out for that central courtyard — or battle across the estate grounds as evening settles in on the location. Keep your head straight through the matches ahead or risk falling prey to the terror of the new haunting.
